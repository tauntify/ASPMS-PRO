## üìã Deployment Checklist

### Critical: Do This First
- [ ] Deploy Firestore indexes: `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes`
- [ ] Wait for index build completion (5-15 minutes)
- [ ] Verify all indexes show "Enabled" in Firebase Console

### Testing Backend
- [ ] Start dev server: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Test timesheet creation endpoint
- [ ] Test invoice creation endpoint
- [ ] Test expense submission endpoint
- [ ] Verify role-based access control

### Frontend Deployment
- [ ] Build application: `npm run build`
- [ ] Test Timesheet Management page
- [ ] Deploy to production: `firebase deploy`

---

## üéØ Quick Win: Timesheet Management

The **Timesheet Management** feature is fully functional end-to-end:

1. **Backend**: All API endpoints working ‚úÖ
2. **Frontend**: Complete UI with all features ‚úÖ
3. **Database**: Schema and indexes ready ‚ö†Ô∏è

**To use it right now:**
1. Deploy Firestore indexes
2. Access `/timesheet-management` route
3. Start logging hours immediately!
