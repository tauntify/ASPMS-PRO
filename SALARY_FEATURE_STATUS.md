## ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS / PENDING

### 5. Salary Management Tab in Principle Dashboard
**What's Needed:**

- For each employee show:
  - Name, Designation
  - Basic Salary + All Allowances = Total Package
  - Current month status (Paid/Unpaid/Held)
  - Attendance summary
  - Pending tasks count
- "Show Salary Details" button for each employee to open modal with:
  - Full salary breakdown
  - Advance payments table
  - Payment history
  - Attendance details
  - Option to mark salary as held/unheld
  - Add advance payment
  - Record salary payment
  - Generate & print salary slip

### 6. Enhanced Salary Slip Generation
**Update employee-dashboard.tsx downloadSalarySlip() to include:**
- Company branding (ARKA Services)
- Employee details (Name, Designation, Employee ID)
- Salary period (Month/Year)
- **Earnings Section:**
  - Basic Salary
  - Traveling Allowance
  - Medical Allowance
  - Food Allowance
  - **Total Earnings**
- **Deductions Section:**
  - Advances Paid (from SalaryAdvance table)
  - Absent Days Deduction (calculated from attendance)
  - Other Deductions
  - **Total Deductions**
- **Net Salary** (Total Earnings - Total Deductions)
- **Payment Details:**
  - Amount Paid
  - Remaining Amount
  - Payment Status
  - Payment Date(s)
- **Attendance Summary:**
  - Total Working Days
  - Present Days
  - Absent Days (excluding Sundays)
  - Deduction per day calculation
- Professional formatting, company footer

### 7. Salary Advance System
**API Routes Needed:**
```typescript
POST /api/salary-advances - Record advance payment
GET /api/salary-advances?employeeId=X - Get employee advances
GET /api/salary-advances?employeeId=X&month=YYYY-MM - Get advances for specific month
```

**UI Components Needed:**
- Modal/dialog to record advance payment
- Table showing all advances with date, amount, reason
- Link advances to specific salary months
- Automatic deduction from salary when generating slip

### 8. Salary Payment Tracking
**API Routes Needed:**
```typescript
POST /api/salary-payments - Record partial/full payment
GET /api/salary-payments?salaryId=X - Get payments for specific salary
```

**Features:**
- Record multiple payments for same salary (installments)
- Track payment method (Cash/Bank/Check)
- Show payment history
- Automatic calculation of remaining amount

### 9. Attendance-Based Salary Deductions
**Logic to Implement:**
```typescript
// Calculate working days (exclude Sundays)
totalWorkingDays = daysInMonth - sundaysInMonth

// Calculate absent deductions
perDaySalary = totalEarnings / totalWorkingDays
absentDays = totalWorkingDays - presentDays
absentDeductions = absentDays * perDaySalary
```

**Integration Points:**
- Automatically calculate when generating salary
- Show breakdown in salary slip
- Update when attendance is marked

### 10. Salary Hold for Pending Tasks
**Logic:**
```typescript
// Check if employee has pending tasks
if (employee.hasPendingTasks && !principleAllowOverride) {
  salary.isHeld = true;
  // Prevent payment and show warning
}
```

**UI Features:**
- Show "Salary Held" badge for employees with pending tasks
- Principle can override and allow payment
- Show pending tasks list in salary details
- Mark salary as held/unheld button

### 11. Firebase Collections to Create
```typescript
// /salaryAdvances
{
  id: string
  employeeId: string
  salaryId?: string // optional link to salary month
  amount: number
  date: Timestamp
  reason?: string
  paidBy: string // principle ID
  createdAt: Timestamp
}

// /salaryPayments
{
  id: string
  salaryId: string
  amount: number
  paymentDate: Timestamp
  paymentMethod?: string
  notes?: string
  paidBy: string
  createdAt: Timestamp
}

// Update /salaries collection
{
  // ... existing fields
  travelingAllowance: number
  medicalAllowance: number
  foodAllowance: number
  totalEarnings: number
  advancePaid: number
  absentDeductions: number
  otherDeductions: number
  totalDeductions: number
  paidAmount: number
  remainingAmount: number
  isHeld: boolean
  attendanceDays: number
  totalWorkingDays: number
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}

// Update /employees collection
{
  // ... existing fields
  designation: string
  basicSalary: number
  travelingAllowance: number
  medicalAllowance: number
  foodAllowance: number
  salaryDate: number
  isSalaryHeld: boolean
}
```
