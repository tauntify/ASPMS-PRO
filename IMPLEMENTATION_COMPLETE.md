## üìã NEXT STEPS (Not Yet Implemented)

### API Routes Needed
```typescript
// Salary Generation
POST /api/salaries/generate
  - Calculate salary based on attendance
  - Deduct advances automatically
  - Calculate absent deductions (excluding Sundays)
  - Create salary record

// Advance Payments
POST /api/salary-advances
GET /api/salary-advances?employeeId=X
DELETE /api/salary-advances/:id

// Payment Tracking
POST /api/salary-payments
GET /api/salary-payments?salaryId=X

// Salary Management
PATCH /api/salaries/:id/hold
PATCH /api/salaries/:id/release
POST /api/salaries/:id/payment
```

### Attendance-Based Deduction Logic
```typescript
// Calculate working days (exclude Sundays)
const daysInMonth = getDaysInMonth(month);
const sundays = countSundays(month);
const workingDays = daysInMonth - sundays;

// Calculate deductions
const perDaySalary = totalEarnings / workingDays;
const absentDays = workingDays - presentDays;
const absentDeductions = absentDays * perDaySalary;
```

### Salary Hold Logic
```typescript
// Check pending tasks
const pendingTasks = await getTasks(employeeId, { status: ['Undone', 'In Progress'] });
if (pendingTasks.length > 0 && !principleOverride) {
  salary.isHeld = true;
  // Prevent salary generation/payment
}
```
