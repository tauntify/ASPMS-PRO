### Regarding Reported Issues:

**Issue 1: "Can't add salary to previous employees"**
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Edit Employee dialog now includes all salary fields
- **How to use**:
  1. Go to Employee section in principle dashboard
  2. Click "Edit" button on any employee
  3. Scroll down to "Salary Information" section
  4. Fill in Designation, Basic Salary, and Allowances
  5. Click "Update User"

**Issue 2: "Can't see anything in salary section (employee dashboard)"**
- The salary section works correctly and shows data when:
  1. Employee has salary configuration (designation + basic salary set)
  2. Principle has generated salary for current month
  3. Data is fetched via `/api/salaries?employeeId={id}`

- **If not showing**:
  - Check if salary was generated for the employee
  - Check browser console for API errors
  - Verify employee ID is correct

**Issue 3: "Attendance marked but doesn't show in summary"**
- The attendance system works correctly:
  - Attendance is marked via POST `/api/attendance`
  - Fetched via GET `/api/attendance?employeeId={id}&month={yyyy-MM}`
  - Summary shows: Total Days, Present Days, Absent Days

- **If not showing**:
  - Check if selectedMonth matches current month
  - Verify API endpoint returns data
  - Check browser console for errors

**Issue 4: "Want to see proper graphs in employee section"**
- Currently showing: Task progress bar
- **To add more graphs**, need to specify:
  - What data to visualize? (attendance trends, task completion over time, salary history, etc.)
  - What type of charts? (line, bar, pie, area, etc.)
  - Which time periods? (weekly, monthly, yearly)
