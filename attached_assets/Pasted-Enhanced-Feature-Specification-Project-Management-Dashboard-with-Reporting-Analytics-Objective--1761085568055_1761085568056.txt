Enhanced Feature Specification: Project Management Dashboard with Reporting & Analytics
Objective: Integrate a comprehensive project tracking, reporting, and dynamic analytics system into my web application.

Core Features:

1. Project Information & Client Details

Client Information: Ability to add and display:

Client Name

Project Title

Project Start Date

Project Delivery Date

Timeline Tracking: The system should calculate and display time remaining until delivery.

2. Interactive Work Progress Tracking

Item Statuses: Each project item must be trackable with the following statuses, each contributing a specific weight to the overall progress:

Purchased (e.g., 25% weight)

In Installation Phase (e.g., 50% weight)

Installed (e.g., 75% weight)

Delivered (e.g., 100% weight)

Dynamic Progress Bar: A main project progress bar must automatically recalculate and update its percentage whenever an item's status checkbox is changed.

3. Dynamic Infographics & Analytics Dashboard
Create a live analytics dashboard that updates in real-time:

Progress Timeline Graph:

Visual timeline from Start Date to Delivery Date

Shows planned progress vs. actual progress

Marks current date and completion percentage

Updates dynamically with every status change

Status Distribution Chart:

Pie chart or bar graph showing distribution of items across different statuses

Real-time updates when items change status

Milestone Tracker:

Visual indicators for key project milestones

Shows upcoming and completed milestones
