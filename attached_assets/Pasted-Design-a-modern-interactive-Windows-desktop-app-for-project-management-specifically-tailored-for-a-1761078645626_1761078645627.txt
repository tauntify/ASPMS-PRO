Design a modern, interactive Windows desktop app for project management, specifically tailored for architecture and interior design professionals. The app should be installable with a setup file and offer a futuristic, cyborg-inspired interface with rich, interactive infographics such as circular graphs and summaries.

Core functional requirements:

Allow users to create unlimited divisions (or categories), with each division containing multiple customizable items.

For each item, enable input of:

Detailed description

Unit of measure (support all commonly used in architecture: number, rft, sft, meter, meter square, gallons, drums, coils, length, etc.)

Quantity

Rate per unit

Automatically calculate the total amount for each item by multiplying quantity with rate, and display running totals for each division.

At the end of all divisions, provide a master summary page that sums all divisions and offers a breakdown of total values.

Enable users to mark each item (or division) with configurable priority levels (High, Mid, Low).

Present a funds summary based on priority categories (e.g., show required funds for all high-priority items separately).

Allow complete flexibility to edit, rename, add, or delete divisions and items as needed.

Implement a dashboard with:

Interactive visual summaries (circular and bar graphs, infographics for costs, quantities, priorities, etc.)

Tables and lists updated live as data is entered.

Support exporting all structured data and visuals in various formats such as Excel sheets, JPEG images, and PDF files.

Ensure the UI is highly modern using cyborg/sci-fi design elements, with smooth interactivity and attractive graphical transitions.

Technical considerations:

The app must be optimized for Windows PC environments (Windows 10 and above).

Include robust data validation and an intuitive workflow for first-time users.

Backend should be efficient enough to handle large data sets (hundreds of items per project).

Exported files must retain all custom field names, summaries, priorities, and graphical elements.
